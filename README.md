- manager (in fact in small companies it is the same person) - Manages the work time of employees, their holidays and messages.
Manager can accept working plan of employee, or resend it to correct. The same way he can accept or not accept the holiday request from workers.
in message system the manager see all received working plans, holiday requests and simple text messages - questions, requests or others.
